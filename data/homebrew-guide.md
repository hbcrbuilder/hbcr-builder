# STARTING GUIDE : HOMEBREW

Given the impressive size of the mod Homebrew and the vast changes it brings to the base game, I figured a "startup" guide would be most useful for newcomers. If you have any questions or issues, be sure to check our very active Discord.

## Quicklinks

1. Complete Documentation

1.1 Gameplay Mechanics

## Alchemy

Alchemy is much easier to accomplish and doesn’t need a feat. Any character can use Alchemy to craft consumables, and characters that pass a DC 16 Medicine check will get two.

Armour & Shields [link]

Every magic item has been changed. Armour and shields have been fully standardized. Armour provides a base AC of 14, which increases to 15 for Rare quality and 16 for Very Rare and Legendary. All Clothing is now classed as Light Armour.

Light Armour: Add your full Dexterity bonus to your AC.

Medium Armour: Add up to 2 of your Dexterity bonus to your AC, and gain physical damage reduction from your Constitution bonus, up to 2 points.

Heavy Armour: Gain physical damage reduction equal to your Constitution bonus. All damage reduction is calculated after damage resistance.

Shields: Shields grant no bonus to AC. Instead, they offer reactions to reduce incoming attack rolls by an amount equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and the ability to retaliate against attackers with either a Shield Bash or weapon strike.

## Attacks

Weapon attacks, including Unarmed attacks, follow a predictable pattern in most classes. The following features determine how many attacks each class gets.

Extra Attack: Grants an additional attack as a free action when you use your action to make a Weapon or Unarmed attack. All classes except Bard, Monk, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard gain Extra Attack, though some gain it through Subclasses.

Improved Extra Attack: Extra Attack now grants two actions each turn instead of granting a free action weapon attack (Extra attack is replaced). Barbarians, Fighters, Paladins, Rangers and Rogues gain Improved Extra Attack at level 9.

Steel Cast: Grants a free action Weapon or Unarmed attack when you use your Action to cast a Spell or Cantrip. Clerics and Druids gain Steel Cast at level 9, along with several weapon-focused Caster subclasses.

## Attunement System

All characters now have an Attunement score equal to 12 plus their level. Equipping a magic item costs a number of Attunement points depending on the rarity. Uncommon (green) items cost 1 point, Rare (blue) items cost 2 points, and Very Rare (purple) and Legendary (gold) items cost 4 points.

This system can be removed via an optional addon available on the download page.

Cantrips [link]

All cantrips have been normalized. Melee cantrips deal 1d12 base damage, while ranged cantrips deal 1d8. Every class and subclass that gets spell slots also gets two cantrips. All cantrips are available to every class. Several cantrips now have new behaviors.

## Carry Weight

Each character’s carry weight has been improved slightly. Additionally, you’ll find that some items have had their weight reduced.

## Character Creation

Backgrounds: Backgrounds no longer provide any proficiencies. They now only function as a source of Inspiration.

Traits: You can pick a single trait at character creation. Traits are optional, and provide both positive and negative effects (Traits).

Classes: Each class has been reduced to 4 specialized subclasses, with each subclass filling a different niche. Every class without full spellcasting now inherently gains Extra Attack at level 5 and Improved Extra Attack at level 9. Cleric and Druid both gain Extra Attack, and the remaining full casters have at least one subclass that provides it. The only exceptions to these rules are Paladin (who gets 5 subclasses), and Monk (who gets extra actions instead of Extra Attack).

Hit Points: All characters gain a base 10 hit points plus their Constitution modifier at first level. Characters gain an additional 6 hit points plus their Constitution modifier at each level up.

Proficiencies: All classes are proficient with all weapons and armour.

Races: All races have been normalized and receive one or two unique features.

Saving Throws: No class receives proficiency in any Saving Throw. Any bonus to a character’s saves is significant now.

Skills: All characters gain 4 skill proficiencies and 2 skill expertise at level 1. All skills are available to all classes.

## Conditions

Nearly every condition in the game has been reworked to function within the systems of Homebrew. For example, the Acid condition reduces Armour Class by 2 and nullifies damage reduction provided by armour. Read your tooltips.

## Consumables

Potions of Healing have been reworked to grow when your Proficiency Bonus increases. Potions of Healing restore 1d12 hit points at first level. The Greater variant restores 2d12, the Superior 3d12, and the Supreme 4d12. Each restores an additional 1d12 hit points when your character reaches level 5 and again at level 9. Elixirs have been rebuilt to be more broadly useful and less build-defining. Grenade style weapons are significantly stronger, especially at low levels. Limited duration weapon coatings are now applied as a Reaction and scale based on your Spellcasting Ability.

## Damage Resistance

Damage Resistance can no longer be bypassed by using magical weapons. You will either need to have a feature that specifically allows you bypass Damage Resistance or use a different damage source.

## Difficulty Class

The formula for Difficulty Class is now Base 10, instead of Base 8. All magical/mental effects utilize your Spellcasting Attribute (denoted by the Star on your character’s attributes) for the Difficulty Class formula, while all physical effects utilize the higher of your Strength and Dexterity scores. Many consumables utilize your Spellcasting Attribute.

The difficulty checks have also been slightly increased in most dialogs.

## Enemies

Enemies in Homebrew have significantly more Health than the standard game. This is especially true if playing with the optional difficulty addons. Most NPCs also have a fixed class and random subclass (certain NPCs have fixed subclasses), and gain feats and passives at the same levels at the same rate as the player. These feats and passives are randomly selected, but make enemies far more dangerous.

Feats [LINK]

Feats have been fully reworked in Homebrew, including the Ability Improvement option. Feats are designed with the intention of shaping and defining gameplay for a character.

## High/Low Ground Modifier

The bonus and penalty for height advantage is now +/- 4, rather than the default +/- 2.

Illithid Powers [link]

Illithid powers are significantly stronger, but come with a damning drawback: characters who choose to learn Illithid powers have their maximum HP reduced by 2 for each power.

## Initiative

Initiative is determined by a roll of 1d10 plus a character’s Dexterity modifier and any other relevant bonuses.

## Inspiration

Inspiration is limited to a single point at any given time. Inspiration is otherwise unchanged by this mod.

This limitation can be removed via an optional addon available on the download page.

## Lockdown Immunity

Bosses (and some characters with Fighter passives) can no longer be stun-locked. Any Dangerous or Fatal enemy will receive Lockdown Immunity for 3 turns after an incapacitation condition expires.

## Long Rests

Long Rests cost 100 (200 on Tactician) camp resources.

You can still tweak your long rest resource cost with the vanilla option in custom games.

## Passives

One of the main features of Homebrew is the addition of class passives. Every class has a list of 20 passives, and you get to pick two at level 2, 6 and 10. Check every class for a complete list. At level 4, 8 and 12, you can trade a feat for 2 passives from another class. This passive system is the core of what makes Homebrew character building so fun and complex.

Races [link]

Every race is viable and has been reworked with a small, flavorful bonus.

Spells [link]

Spellcasting has been completely overhauled. All spells are now cast at first level, and can be upcast using higher level spell slots. Upcasting provides bonuses relevant to the spell, such as improved damage, increased range, additional targets, etc. Not all spells provide benefits for upcasting. Spells have also been standardized amongst themselves. Damage spells use similar dice, area spells use similar areas (with a few exceptions), debuffs use similar durations, etc.

Spellcasting classes and subclasses have also seen changes. For starters, every casting class or subclass is now either a Full or Half caster. Half casters use the same spell slot progression as Full casters, but only progress every other level. Spell slot progression is also different than in the base game. At level 12 a Full caster will have 4 spell slots for ranks 1-3 and 2 spell slots for ranks 4-6. A Half caster will have 4 spell slots for ranks 1-3.

Every Full spellcasting class will also have access to some form of spell slot recovery, either through a class feature or optional passives. Bard is the exception with no ability to recover spell slots, though one of its subclasses allows the Bard to cast spells without consuming spell slots.

All spellcasters now use the Spells Known system. Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Wizards no longer prepare spells ahead of time. Instead, every Full spellcaster learns 2 spells from their spell lists at each level. Half casters learn 1 spell from their spell list. At class levels 3, 7, and 11, the spellcaster may instead select spells from any spell list. Bards and Monks (Way of the Arcane) are unusual in that they do not have spell lists and may instead select spells from any spell list each time they gain spells. Bards are further unusual in that they may only select a single spell at each level, with the exception of the College of Lore, which may select 2. Wizards still have the ability to learn additional spells from scrolls, but the costs are significantly higher.

Multiclassing spellcasters is now very straightforward. Unlike in the base game, spellcasters do not contribute to the growth of other spellcasting classes. All spell slots are earned separately based on class level, and then added together. Spell slots can be used by any spellcasting class the character has.

Example: A character with 3 levels in Wizard would have 4 first level spell slots and 2 second levels spell slots. If that character took 1 level in Bard they would now have 6 first level spell slots and 2 second level spell slots.

## Trinkets

Thanks to the full integration of Discordant Instruments, you will find dozens of trinkets in the world (magic items you can equip in the instrument slot) to complement your build. These trinkets have been significantly changed to fit the systems of the Homebrew mod.

Weapons [link]

Weapon damage has been standardized. One-handed weapons now deal 1d8 damage. Two-handed Weapons and Versatile Weapons with nothing in your off-hand now deal 1d12 damage. Hand Crossbows deal 1d8 damage and have a range of 9m/30ft. All other ranged weapons deal 1d12 damage and have a range of 18m/60ft. Every weapon type has 3 different weapon actions.

Some weapon categories also have new behaviors. For example, longswords and glaives now have the Finesse property.

Strength also applies as a Global Strength modifier. If you are attacking with a melee weapon with no weapon in your off-hand, your Strength modifier is added to the damage. Functionally, this means that Dexterity and Spellcasting Attribute attackers can still benefit from a higher Strength score, and Strength attackers will get to apply their Strength modifier twice.

Dual Wielding: Off-hand attacks are now made automatically when you make a basic attack with your main-hand weapon. Off-hand attacks never gain your attack attribute as damage, and many effects only target or utilize your main-hand weapon.

Free Handling: When wielding a one-handed weapon or versatile weapon with nothing in your off-hand you gain the Free Handling condition. Free Handling grants a +2 bonus to your Attack Rolls and Initiative roll, and provides an additional Action once every 3 turns.

Versatile Weapons: Versatile weapons can be used to dual wield or for Free Handling. Versatile weapons deal 1d12 damage when Free Handling, unlike one-handed weapons. Hand crossbows allow you to use your reactions to attack as long as you are sneaking or invisible.

Two-Handed Weapons: Two-handed Great weapons (not Versatile) gain a special feature called Overwhelm. Overwhelm adds twice your proficiency bonus to all damage rolls. Additionally, when you miss an attack, you may use a free reaction to inflict your Overwhelm damage to your target. Two-handed polearm weapons allow you to strike with the haft of your polearm for free once per turn and have the “Reach” property.

GUIDES [LINK]

You can find here the list of guides written by the community. Keep in mind that some of these guides might be slightly out of date - Homebrew is updated regularly.

2. Mod Compatibility

First of all, please ensure you have the Script Extender and Mod Configuration Menu installed - it's the only (soft) requirement of this mod. Also make sure that you have installed the Localization Fixer, in the Homebrew download page.

This is a complete gameplay overhaul (think : Requiem for Skyrim). As such, compatibility with other mods touching the same systems is tricky. As a rule of thumb, most mods adding or modifying classes, races, NPCs or spells are not compatible. They might work, but they will totally affect the balance and the coherence of Homebrew in some way. Check our Discord for compatibility patches for popular mods.

I would also strongly advise against using other difficulty enhancing mods (like Combat Extender or Tactician Plus) even if you are a hardcore player. This overhaul is difficult. If you are a veteran player, you can adjust the MCM sliders and/or use the “Less exp” addon, which reduces experience by +-25%.

UnlockLevelCurve is not "supported" because HaVeNII7 didn't add any abilities past lvl 12. You can however use it and multiclass just fine if you really want to. Balance will obviously be affected. Mods affecting the leveling curve are 100% compatible tho (I personally use Custom XP to decrease XP by 35%), as long as you don't use the optional XP add-on.

Please note that many mods are already incorporated (and modified) by this overhaul, and should not be installed with Homebrew : SNEKUI﻿, More Battle Master Maneuvers, Metamagic Extended, Metamagic Enhanced,﻿ Secret Scrolls﻿, Secret Scrolls for 5e Spells, Discordant Instruments﻿ and 5e Spells. Be sure to uninstall﻿ those mods before installing Homebrew.

Mods adding new items are compatible, but they need a patch or they won't have any Attunement cost.

The vast majority of other mods (cosmetic mods, interface and UI mods, ...) are 100% compatible. You can also check this post : Compatible Mods

3. General Advice

Forget most of what you know about BG3 or D&D 5e. You will need to relearn a lot of mechanics. Homebrew is absolutely balanced (and is still being balanced with regular updates), but its balance is very different from vanilla.

Be sure to tweak the difficulty in the MCM menu as you see fit! Nobody will judge you.

Your vanilla builds can still work, but would probably need (a lot of) adjustments. Tanking and healing are not only viable, but also really strong. A dedicated healer can out-heal damage, and a tank can taunt and draw attention. Support builds are really effective.

If you want a few tips to create your own build, you can check this guide. As a rule of thumb, control is always good.

Don't feel overwhelmed by the spells you see on level 1 in a caster class, you have access to all spells from the start. Luckily they all scale the same way, so you can just pick your preferred type and effects without fear of missing out on power. There is no wrong spell choice : they all fulfill a unique niche.

You have a lot more options for Bonus Actions and Reactions than in vanilla. Try to always make use of all three types of actions every turn. If a character does not always have stuff to do with his BAs/reactions, give him a shield - it will provide both - or check for passives/feats.

As a rule of thumb, enemies get access to the same Passives (at lvl 2, 6 and 10) and Feats (at lvl 4, 8 and 12) as the player. Examining enemies is essential, especially if you play Honor Mode. If you face Wizards, be prepared for Telekinetic Pull. If you face Rangers, they will summon really strong companions. A particular feat can make a boss really hard to defeat.

Class passives, feats and subclasses on enemies are random and won't be the same in every playthrough.

The mod can be challenging at first, but will reward you as you learn the cool combos and synergies. You will feel a great power spike at every level up. However, be prepared for some really tough fights in Act 1, 2 and 3.

Never update mid save, unless HaVeNII7 says it's safe to do so. Usually : New patch, New game.

4. A Word On Difficulty

You can customize Homebrew difficulty with the integrated MCM menu inside the game, and the optional addon to reduce experience gain.

The recommended difficulty is Tactician or Honor Mode, with a 4 character party and the MCM options of your choice.

⭐⭐Orange : Medium difficulty increase
⭐⭐⭐Red : Major difficulty increase

⭐⭐MCM - HP : Easy is really easy. Normal is the intended experience for the average user. Anything further will add more and more HP to NPCs. Nightmare is intended for 5+ party members.

⭐⭐MCM - Stats : Increases enemy AC, Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Spell Save DC by an amount equal to their Proficiency Bonus. If you feel like NPCs are not challenging enough after act 1, this is a good way to make them scale.

⭐⭐⭐Harder difficulty Addon - Slower Level Curve : You need around 30% more experience to level up. You will still reach max level in act 3, just later. Recommended if you are a completionist. This makes the early and mid game much more difficult.

⭐⭐⭐MCM - Resources : You can add an additional Action, Bonus Action and Reaction to NPCs. This affects the action economy in a huge way, and this is NOT recommended for new players.

It is not recommended to move the HP slider mid-fight, because it will reset every NPC’s Health to max! But you can safely modify the difficulty mid game.

If you are lost, be sure to check our Discord. Our community is always happy to help!

In our Discord, you will also find a ton of community addons to further customize your Homebrew experience (new subclasses, compatibility patches for popular mods, ...).

5. Aether Suspension Explained

Now, every character will have two passives by default, which they can toggle on and off : Aether Suspension, and Aether Suspension: Final Stand.

Upon toggling Aether Suspension on any given character, they will immediately vanish when combat starts (or on their first turn, if joining late). You will be unable to act, take damage, the AI will not target you, etc. The effect will disappear once combat has ended, or when there are only characters with Aether Suspension left within the combat encounter. Should the only characters left alive be those with Aether Suspension, a game over will occur.

Upon toggling Aether Suspension: Final Stand, just like with the usual variant, the character will vanish when combat starts. However, the difference with Final Stand is that these characters will actually rejoin combat IF the rest of your party falls in battle. Essentially, this passive allows you to bring multiple "waves" of party members, without having a huge numbers / action economy advantage for the fight. Should a character join combat late with one of these two passives toggled, they will vanish once their turn rolls around.

Upon fleeing combat, all characters who were under the effects of standard Aether Suspension are given a new status, "Left for Dead". They will immediately lose the effects of Aether Suspension and have three turns to resolve their combat encounter, be it through winning or fleeing. If they fail to do so within three turns, they will immediately die. Choosing to run from a combat encounter can now incur some actual risk.

These can be used together in any way you see fit to form your party composition. Want to run a two man party, with a three man backup squad? You can do it. Four man party with a two man backup? You bet.

And of course, these passives can be simply removed from your hotbar and completely ignored if you don't want to use them. It will simply allow those with larger party sizes to maintain more balanced combat while also seeing more story at once.

All compatibility with Sit This One Out 2 is maintained, and all aura based effects which were compatible with Sit This One Out 2 will also work with Aether Suspension.

Do note that you probably still want a party limit remover mod if you plan to play with this mechanic.

## Afterword

Documentation for the BG3 Homebrew Mod is created and maintained by its community of players. It is the continued labor of many people who have dedicated their time and energy to making sure that this incredibly robust mod can be understood and navigated successfully.

If you notice any errors, inconsistencies, or missing information, please don’t hesitate to let us know on the Discord! These documents are only valuable if they’re accurate.
